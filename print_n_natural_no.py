'''
You need to write a program that reads a number (n) and prints all numbers from 1 up to (n). However, thereâ€Ÿs a twist: keep the initialization part outside of the for loop. 
How will you structure your program to accomplish this?
Sample input: 
Assume that N =5. 
Sample output: 
The first 5 natural numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
'''

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))  
i = 1 

print(f"The first {n} natural numbers are:", end=" ")

for i in range(i, n + 1):  
    print(i, end=", " if i < n else "\n")
